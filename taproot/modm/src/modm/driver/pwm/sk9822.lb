# SK9822 RGB LED Driver

Drives any number of chained SK9822 RGB LEDs using SPI signals SCK and MOSI up
to a few dozen MHz. Due to the synchronous clock, there are no special
restrictions on protocol timing, making this driver safe to use with interrupts
enabled and/or with an RTOS.

The internal data buffer size is 4B for start of frame, 4B for every LED and 1B
for every 16 LEDs as end of frame.
