 * \ingroup		modm_processing_rtos
 *
 * FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system for embedded devices, being ported
 * to several microcontrollers. It is distributed under the GPL with an
 * optional exception.
 * The exception permits users' proprietary code to remain closed source while
 * maintaining the kernel itself as open source, thereby facilitating the use
 * of FreeRTOS in proprietary applications.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Small and simple. Very good for hobbyists who are new to OSes.
 * - Scheduler can be configured for both preemptive or cooperative operation.
 * - Coroutine support (Coroutine in FreeRTOS is a very simple and lightweight
 *   thread that has very limited use of stack)
 *
