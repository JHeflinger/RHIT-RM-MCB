This is a virtual release only for reference that covers everything from
2019-04-01.

Breaking changes:

- Upgrade to AWS a:FreeRTOS v10 with generic port to all Cortex-M devices.
- `modm::endl` does not flush the IOStream anymore.

Features:

- New printf implementation with better overall syntax support.
- Simple CRC32 implementation.
- Cortex-M: CrashCatcher integration for post-mortem debugging of HardFaults.
- Cortex-M: ITM driver with UART interface.
- Cortex-M: GNU Build ID integration.

Fixes:

- AVR: UART driver for some devices.

New development boards:

- Arduino NANO as `modm:board:arduino-nano`.
- NUCLEO-F446RE as `modm:board:nucleo-f446re`.

New device drivers:

- WS2812 RGB LED driver as `modm:driver:ws2812`.
