## 2020-01-01: Virtual 2019q4 release

This is a virtual release only for reference that covers everything from
2019-10-01.

Breaking changes:

- `modm:target` option requires extended identifiers.

Features:

- STM32G4 support!
- DFU programmer support.
- STM32G0: Add ADC driver.

Fixes:

- NUCLEO-F303K8: SystemClock for USART1 and I2C1.
- STM32: I2C NACK interrupt.

New development boards:

- NUCLEO-G474RE as `modm:board:nucleo-g474re`.
- Black Pill F401 as `modm:board:mini-f401`
- Black Pill F411 as `modm:board:mini-f411`

New device drivers:

- SK9822 LED driver (via APA102) as `modm:driver:sk9822`.

Known bugs:

- `lbuild build` and `lbuild clean` do not remove all previously generated files
  when the configuration changes. See #285.
- Generating modm on Windows creates paths with `\` that are not compatible with
  Unix. See #310.
